# factorials
find factorial of any number using recursion in python

recursion is process in which a function calls it self.

note: adding a condition statement in necessary while using recursion beacuse the programe may start running in a never ending loop and end up crashing tha terminal!

here for finding the factorial of the given number
i used a simple formula: n x (n-1)!
where n is the given number
and n-1 is the factorial of the previous number
